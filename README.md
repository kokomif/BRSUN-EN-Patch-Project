# BRSUN-EN-Patch-Project
## The Game Already EOS long ago but, The spirit to make English patch still alive!

This patch uses ```BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.704```, which has been modified to work with the BRSun game.

**Installed Plugins**
- [XUnity.AutoTranslator-BepInEx-IL2CPP-5.4.5](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator)
- [BepInEx.Utility.IL2CPP EnableFullScreenToggleIL2CPP_net6](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.Utility.IL2CPP)

**Patch Release Versions**
- Contains only the necessary patch files.
- Contains patch and partially translated content into English.

**Installation**
- Download the desired patch files from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/kokomif/BRSUN-EN-Patch-Project/releases).
- Extract the .zip file in the game folder

**Known Issues**
- The in-game UI of a BepInEx mod (like XUnity's GUI) is completely broken. However, this is not an essential function. The patch works without the GUI, and you can edit its configuration in the plugin's `.cfg` file.

**Change Log**
v0.2

Update Translated Main Story up to CASE02

v0.1 

Initial Release of necessary patch files and partially translated content into English (Home UI, Enhance Menu, Party Menu, Passive Effect, and Partial of CASE00 main story)
